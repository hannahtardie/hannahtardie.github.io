    <p1 id = "subtitle"> this website was made for the 3d text workshop, led by hannah tardie. it includes programming references, literary theory, example interactions, and fun images.
    </p1>
    <p id = "second-section"> ...
    </p>
<p2 id = "intro">this project started with a literary interest in postcolonial and de-colonial theory. it continued while reading Shelley Jackson's hyptertext fiction "patchwork girl." the hypertext genre demonstrates
fragmentation, liminal space, and non-linear experience.  </p2>
<p3 id = "p1"> computational manipulations of text
can be used to illustrate the multiplicity of identity
including complexities like
gender, race, and diaspora.</p3>
<p4 id = "p2"> this workshop is about using text in digital media to negotiate or intervene in space. </p4>
<p5 id = "p3"> taking Said's scholarship into account, we can think about the novel and other forms of writing as colonialist and problematic in their narrative structure, and also their form. </p5>

“Texts are not finished objects.”
― Edward W. Said, Culture and Imperialism </blockquote>
<blockquote id = "second-quote">
"The appropriation of history, the historicization of the past, the narrativization of society, all of which give the novel its force, include the accumulation and differentiation of social space, space to be used for social purposes."
― Edward W. Said, Culture and Imperialism </blockquote>
<blockquote id = "third-quote">
  “The main battle in imperialism is over land, of course; but when it came to who owned the land, who had the right to settle and work on it, who kept it going, who won it back, and now plans its future--these issues were reflected, contested, and even for a time decided in narrative. As one critic has suggested, nations themselves are narrations.”
  ― Edward Said, Culture and Imperialism  </blockquote>
  <blockquote id = "hooks-space">
    “That space of refusal, where on can say no to the colonizer, no to the down pressor, is located in the margins. And one can only say no, speak the voice of resistance, because there exists a counter language. While it may resemble in ways the colonizer’s tongue it has undergone a transformation, it has been irrevocably changed.” - bell hooks, choosing the margin as a space for radical openness
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote id = "hooks-worlds">
     “…I was working in these statements to identify marginality as much more than a site of deprivation, in fact I was saying just the opposite: that it is also the site of radical possibility, a space of resistance. It was this marginality that I was naming as a central location for the production of a counter hegemonic discourse that is not just found in words but in habits of being and the way one lives. As such I was not speaking of a marginality one wishes to lose - to give up or surrender as part of moving into the centre - but rather as a site one stays in, clings to even because it nourishes one's capacity to resist. It offers to one the possibility of radical perspective from which to see and create, to imagine alternatives, new worlds.” - bell hooks, choosing the margin as a space for radical openness
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote id = "hooks-literary">
      “ Spaces can be real and imagined. Spaces can tell stories and unfold histories. Spaces can be interrupted, appropriated and transformed through artistic and literary practice.” - bell hooks, choosing the margin as a space for radical openness
